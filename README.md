# JavaAssignment
This java assignment demonstrates my understanding and use of various OOP concepts.

Core Functionality:  Build a tool that shows
interesting facts from a dataset taken from 
data.gov.ie. The dataset that I chose was 
"Unemployment Rate of Persons 25-64 years".
It contains data from 2009 to 2021 about
gender, education level and the rate of 
unemployment. I have implemented a button
which will save a random diagram to the user's
PC. The diagram is one of: Bar chart, pie chart
or line chart for a visual representation of the SQL
queries. 

Optional Functionality: Users can query the database by wrtiting their 
own SQL clauses, and view the results in a table, or they can input 3 values,
Year, Sex and Education Level and be shown the result.

If I had more time for this project, I would add extensive error checking 
as we are dealing with a database, it is very vunerable to SQL injection.
I would also add some flexibilty, for examp,e your queries dont need to 
be exact, possibly using all lowercase or wildcards.
